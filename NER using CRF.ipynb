    "Natural language processing is, let's be honest, seriously biased towards English and if your customer happens to be in a cutural region where it's not the main language you have an issue. Or an opportunity to articulate something new. In any case, you have a few challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- finding relevant data: preferably free to use and pre-tagged. A ton of pdf's will not do.\n",
    "- some language understanding: stop-words, sentence structure and such.\n",
    "- framework understanding: if your favorite NLP framework doesn't contain pre-trained models for the language you have to dig a bit deeper to build things yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article I'll focus on Dutch since this happens to be one of the common languages here in Belgium. While this isn't spoken by many (compared to, say, French or Spanish) it nevertheless \n",
    "\n",
    "- happens to have some support in frameworks like Gensim, SpaCy and NLTK\n",
    "- isn't as challenging as Chinse, Greek or Bulgarian: Dutch uses the standard Latin alphabet \n",
    "- is not wildly different from English when considering things like lemmatization or sentence splitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The availability of (trained) data is a real issue however and Dutch is in this respect the prototypical situation: it's difficult to find quality (tagged) data. The emphasis here is on tagged and quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- of course you have things like [Gutenberg](http://gutenberg.org/) but books alone won't get you very far if you are interested in extracting information out of data. You need labels, tags or something which relates to what you're after. Machine (and human) learning is based on patterns in relationships.\n",
    "- unstructured texts means you'll spend first an eternity cleaning data before effectively turning to the task at hand. A customer handing over a million of pdf's and expecting you to extract magically all they need out of it is a common misunderstanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, assuming the data is present you can start exploring various NLP tasks. For marketing purposes one can look at sentiment analysis in function of product placement or customer propensity. If you need to classify documents you can look at summarization or keyword extraction. Note that if your corpus is large you might benefit from things like [Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/) rather than an homemade engine. In function of a realtime NLP engine (e.g. processing telephone calls) you can look at entity extraction aka named entity recognition (NER). \n",
    "\n",
    "Every NLP process is really based on the following recipe:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **gather data**, preferably tons of it. As many docs as possible.\n",
    "- **clean the data**: remove stop words, noise, irrelevant bits, whatnot\n",
    "- **chunk the data** in a way it suits your aims\n",
    "- **label the parts** in a way the learning step can use it: if you are interested in sentiments label paragraphs or words with some emotional coefficient, if you are after part-of-speech label words with POS tags etc.\n",
    "- find a way to **convert words and labels to numbers**: machine learning does not handle words or characters but numbers. Use anything which makes it happen: word-to-vectors, feature functions, counting (bag of words, matrix...)\n",
    "- figure out **what algorithm works best**, use whatever framework to train a model\n",
    "- define test data or a way to **test the accuracy** of the model\n",
    "- **optimize the accuracy** throuhg gridsearch or whatever works best\n",
    "- **wrap the model** in a consumable, say a REST service or server-less micro-service\n",
    "- keep trying to **improve the model** in whatever way you can\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes some of the steps can be skipped. For example, if you find tagged POS data you don't need to clean/tag things yourself. Similarly, often you have various algorithms at your disposal in an NLP framework which fit perfectly. The devil is in the details, of course. Maybe NLTK is great for a small corpus but will not do if you need a Spark cluster to deal with petabytes. For a medium corpus you might need to develop your own out-of-memory algorithm. Plenty of subtleties indeed and the road to a good model is never linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows I'll focus on **NER in Dutch input** and show how you can train your own NER model. The recipe describe above translates to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the NLP conference of 2002 in Taiwan produced the so-called CoNLL2002 corpus with a mix of Spanish and Dutch tagged data. This corpus sits in the NLTK framework and is easily accessible. A much larger corpus is available but is not free and demands an out-of-memory approach. The so-called [SoNaR corpus](http://tst-centrale.org/nl/tst-materialen/corpora/sonar-corpus-detail) is a 60 GB compressed corpus with around 500 million words but requires a different approach than the one we outline below.\n",
    "- cleaning the data is not necessary in this case because POS and IOB tags are present. If this is not the case in your project you have a major logistic challenge. Annotating text data is in many ways a hurdle.\n",
    "- the NLTK framework knows about Dutch stop-words and tokenization. This makes it easy to chunk the raw text into sentences and words.\n",
    "- the CoNLL2002 corpus contains IOB and POS labels. It doesn't mean that the info can be used as such however. Feature extraction and engineering is in any machine learning (ML) task an art on its own.\n",
    "- we will use conditional random fields (CRF) to create a NER model. A CRF sits in between basic standard NML algorithms (say, SVM) and non-linear algorithms like LSTM neural networks in terms of complexity. Just like an LSTM network a CRF has knowledge about how bits of data are related. It also has similarities with hidden Markov models (HMM) but generalizes the notion of dependency. Using LSTM would engender a whole playful process of optimizing layers and transition functions. Note, I'm telling you a GRU or LSTM would not perform better than CRF, only that it make it more complex to optimize and to describe.\n",
    "- using scikit-learn's grid search the accuracy is optimized across a hyperparameter domain\n",
    "- we'll wrap the model in a simple REST service using Flask. This can be deployed on AWS or as a docker container. In fact, you can find in [the github repo](https://github.com/Orbifold/dutch-ner) the dockerfile for dockerization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional random fields in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "For a thorough overview see [An introduction to conditional random fields](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/csutton/publications/crftut-fnt.pdf) by Charles Sutton and Andrew McCallum in *Machine Learning Vol. 4, No. 4 (2011) 267â€“373*. Here I'll only skim the surface to give you an idea how things function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with textual data you need to find a way to convert text to numbers. A common approach is to use embeddings like [word2vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) or [doc2vec](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/doc2vec.html). Another or complementary approach is to use **feature functions**; ad-hoc mappings from words to numbers. Say you have sentences $s$ with word labels $(w_i, \\lambda_i)$. This could be POS or IOB tags. A feature function $f_j$ maps the $(w_i, \\lambda_i)\\mapsto f_j(w_i, \\lambda_i)$ to some number. For example, a feature function could emphasize adjective and assign the number one when an adjective is found and zero otherwise. In general a feature function can take a window into account. The feature function could look at the previous word or the next-next-word as well. This is where it differentiates from LSTM or HMM. An hidden MArkov model only takes the current state into account. An LSTM tries to remember things in function of the defined windows. So, the feature function could be $f_j(w_i, w{i-1}, \\lambda_i)$ if the previous word is included. \n",
    "For a given sentence you can have multiple feature function. One to pick up names of locations, names of organizations and so on. Each feature function is now weighted and for one sentence you get the sum\n",
    "\n",
    "$S(s, \\lambda) = \\sum_{ij} \\rho_j f_j(w_i, w_{i-1}, \\lambda_i) $\n",
    "\n",
    "specific to the labeling and the sentence under consideration. Now to turn this into a probability you use the usual softmax and get \n",
    "\n",
    "$p(s, \\lambda) = \\frac{1}{Z}\\exp - S(s, \\lambda) $\n",
    "\n",
    "with $Z$ the partition function or normalization to ensure that the probabilities sum up to one. Now the machine learning consists of optimizing the $\\lambda$'s to maximize the probabilities. This happens by means of gradient ascend and is similar to training a neural network and alike. Of course, you need lots of sentences and feature function which effectively return what you are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the training returns optimal weights one can use (polynomial-time) dynamic programming algorithms to find the optimal labels, similar to the [Viterbi algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm) for HMMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NLTK in a nutshell\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural language toolkit is ideal for experimenting with NLP. Probably it's not the tool you'd use for large scale text processing, but that's another topic. It contains all you need to experiment with text and there are many subtletites you need to be aware of when looking at something else than English.\n",
    "\n",
    "- splitting documents into useful paragraphs or blocks is usually something outside the scope of NLTK. If you want to split stanzas in poems you will have to look at line separations. If you want to extract addresses out of Word documents you will have to find appropriate ways to delete obsolete parts of look at markers which define begin/end of the blocks.\n",
    "- splitting paragraphs in sentences is language dependent. This might be a surprise since you naively could assume that splitting at the '.?!' is all you need to do. Things like 'Ph.D.' (English) and 'dhr.' (Dutch) spoil the fun however. Language specific sentence splitting is not too difficult using the [NLTK trainer](https://github.com/japerk/nltk-trainer) and we'll hightlight the procedure below.\n",
    "- splitting sentences in words is also language dependent. The Dutch *'s avonds* is one word but in English the *'s* will be considered as the word 'is' and hence a word on its own. Word tokenizing is hence something which has to be trained as well. Here again, there are tools and open source projects which can help you. The problem is usually finding quality data to train the tokenizer.\n",
    "- removing punctuation is the easy part and can often even be done with regular expressions \n",
    "- removing stop-words is also easy since Dutch, like English, has a limited set of stop words and NLTK actually contains them as a resource\n",
    "- verbs and tenses: the proliferation of the same thing in many shapes. The process of normalizing words to a common root shape is called lemmatization and stemming (the difference is subtle). NLTK can help you with this but like anything else: maybe you need to train your own model. For example, using the 1604 King James Bible with the current English stemmer will not give the expected result. Dialects (the difference between Flemish and Dutch for instance) can also inject mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this article you will find a collection of code snippets which show you how NLTK deals with the aspects enumerated above.\n",

    "One important remark is in order. You can see that the whole training and testing data is loaded in memory. This approach obviously does not work with large datasets and there are so-called [out-of-core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-core_algorithm) algorithms which can help. This means however that you need to figure out how training can happen incrementally. Or you need a different approach, for example using [MLlib with a Spark cluster](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.1.0/mllib-feature-extraction.html) which eventually demands some experience with Scala or PySpark.\n",
